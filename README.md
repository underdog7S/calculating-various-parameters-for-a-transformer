# calculating-various-parameters-for-a-transformer
calculating various parameters for a transformer the primary and secondary voltages, power, copper density, and other factors to determine the core cross-sectional area, number of turns in the primary and secondary coils, and maximum flux density. These calculations are fundamental to designing and analyzing a transformer.
